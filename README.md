# FILE PERMISSIONS IN LINUX LAB

## Objective

This lab demonstrates my capabilities in updating file permissions in Linux. In this scenario, the research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions to reflect the correct level of authorization. This involves reviewing current permissions, identifying discrepancies, and adjusting settings accordingly. Ultimately, the new file permissions mitigate potential risks associated with unauthorized access.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced comprehension of file permissions and ownership nuances in Linux.
- Mastery of command-line utilities such as 'chmod' and 'chown'.
- Proficiency in diagnosing and resolving permission-related challenges.
- Comprehensive knowledge of permission levels (user, group, others) and their practical implementation.
- Enhanced critical thinking and problem-solving abilities applicable to cybersecurity contexts.


### Tools Used

- Linux (Debian)

### Step Four

Description: Provide recommendations, related to controls and/or compliance needs, to reduce risks to assets and improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

Botium Toys lacks several crucial security controls. These include: Least Privilege, password policies, an IDS, legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system. Sensitive information is currently open to threats, both internal and external, due to the weak security posture.

Additionally, several gaps in compliance exist. Botium Toys  will need to properly classify assets in order to address potential gaps in security posture that were not caught by this security audit. This will enable the company to better protect sensitive information.
